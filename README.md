Neurological brain disorders encompass a range of conditions affecting cognitive function, motor skills, and overall brain health. Among them, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s and various forms of dementia are particularly concerning due to their progressive nature. These disorders gradually destroy brain cells, leading to cognitive decline, brain atrophy, and loss of independence. Dementia, characterized by memory loss, impaired reasoning, and social difficulties, significantly hinders daily functioning. The rising global life expectancy has contributed to the increasing prevalence of such conditions, placing immense pressure on caregivers and healthcare systems. Addressing these challenges necessitates a deeper understanding ofneurodegeneration and the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic solutions.
