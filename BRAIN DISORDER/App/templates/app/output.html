        <div class="section">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Absence seizures, also known as petit mal seizures, are a type of generalized seizure that involves a brief loss of consciousness. They are most common in children and are characterized by a sudden, brief staring spell or "blanking out." These seizures typically last for only a few seconds but can occur multiple times throughout the day.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of absence seizures is often unknown, but several factors may contribute, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Genetic factors: Some children may be genetically predisposed to develop absence seizures.</li>
                <li>Abnormal brain electrical activity: The brainâ€™s electrical activity may become abnormal, leading to seizures.</li>
                <li>Neurological conditions: Other underlying neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, can contribute to absence seizures.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of absence seizures typically include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A brief blank stare or loss of awareness</li>
                <li>Unresponsiveness during the seizure</li>
                <li>Rapid eye blinking or slight movements, such as lip-smacking</li>
                <li>Immediate resumption of normal activity after the seizure ends</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Absence seizures can often be controlled with the following treatments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs):</strong> Medications like ethosuximide or valproic acid are commonly used to control absence seizures.</li>
                <li><strong>Dietary changes:</strong> In some cases, a ketogenic diet may be recommended to help control seizures.</li>
                <li><strong>Vagus nerve stimulation:</strong> For patients who don't respond to medications, a device may be implanted to help control seizures.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>While absence seizures may not always be preventable, some steps can help manage the condition:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adhering to prescribed medication regimens.</li>
                <li>Avoiding triggers, such as lack of sleep, stress, or flashing lights, which may provoke seizures.</li>
                <li>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with adequate rest and balanced nutrition.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Precautions</h2>
            <p>If you or your child has been diagnosed with absence seizures, consider taking the following precautions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure a safe environment by removing potential hazards, such as sharp objects, during a seizure.</li>
                <li>Monitor for any changes in seizure frequency or severity and consult your healthcare provider.</li>
                <li>Wear medical alert identification in case of emergency.</li>
                <li>Educate family members and caregivers about how to respond during an absence seizure.</li>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>An onset seizure is the initial occurrence or first signs of a seizure episode, which can happen unexpectedly. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and can vary in type, severity, and duration. The onset of seizures can be triggered by a variety of factors such as neurological disorders, head trauma, or other medical conditions.</p>
            </div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Epilepsy or seizure disorders</li>
                    <li>Head trauma or injury to the brain</li>
                    <li>Brain infections (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis)</li>
                    <li>Stroke or brain tumors</li>

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <p>Treatment for seizures depends on the underlying cause and type of seizure. Common approaches include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Anti-seizure medications (also called anticonvulsants) are commonly prescribed to control and prevent seizures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dietary therapies:</strong> For some individuals, a ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carb) may help reduce seizures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> In rare cases, surgery may be considered if seizures are resistant to medication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS):</strong> A device implanted under the skin that stimulates the vagus nerve to reduce seizures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive neurostimulation (RNS):</strong> A device that monitors brain activity and delivers electrical impulses to prevent seizures.</li>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Prevention</h2>
                <p>While seizures cannot always be prevented, the risk can be minimized by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adhering to prescribed seizure medications and treatment plans.</li>
                    <li>Avoiding known seizure triggers, such as lack of sleep or flashing lights.</li>
                    <li>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and stress management techniques.</li>
                    <li>Avoiding alcohol or drug abuse, which can trigger seizures.</li>
                    <li>Regular monitoring and management of underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes, epilepsy).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Avoiding potentially dangerous activities during a seizure, such as swimming or driving.</li>
                    <li>Wearing medical identification that indicates a seizure disorder.</li>
                    <li>Creating a safe environment to prevent injury during a seizure episode.</li>
                    <li>Seeking medical advice immediately if seizures occur more frequently or if there are significant changes in seizure patterns.</li>
